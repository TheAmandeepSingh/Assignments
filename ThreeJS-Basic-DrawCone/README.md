# THREEJS - BASIC SCRIPT

Hello!

This is a basic script to draw solid cone and triangle face with THREEJS library

## References
1. To start with ThreeJS:
    https://threejs.org/docs

2. Draw Cone: https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/ConeGeometry

3. Draw Triangle Face:
Basically, first we need to define the triangle using three vertices. And that shape can be passed as a parameter to the constructor of ShapeGeometry() to create the geometry.
